I had a very good experience with JML and felt they represented me very well from start to finish. I felt they were very fair all around. I was in good hands. Good communication and great legal representation. Brought issues down to my level so I completely understood my options. Felt like I was talking to good friends who really cared.",

            "description": "As I write this I\u2019m saddened and happy the lawyer I had at this firm did NOT do her due diligence and investigate my case. I was released from a probationary period from a job due to the fact I was having medical issues and on new medication that caused me to have lapse in judgment, cognitive impairment and the ability to think clearly. Although my employer had a taped admittance to changing some dates on paperwork, my new law firm contacted my doctors and independent medical professionals to confirm with a judge the confession was invalid. As soon as the county was going to impose a countersuit against me she backed down.  In my confession it was clearly stated multiple times I couldn\u2019t remember specifics dates and times . I am now in arbitration to further my case with a positive result. My lawyer at this firm was very condescending and treated me as a criminal from the first time we talked, poor representation and unprofessional behavior from her .",

            "description": "I know you may be reading this review because you are in a situation that may need a lawyer. If you find that is the case (no pun intended), then I would recommend JML Law above all others.I wasn't too comfortable with a situation that occurred and thought the same as maybe you, should I or shouldn't I seek litigation? I can say after all is said and done, it was the right decision. My integrity and work ethic has always been a sense of pride for me. I believed that if you work hard, there would be a reward. For the last 20 years, that had been the case until now. When things went sideways in my life, I reached out to JML and wanted to know if I was \"crazy\" for wanting to fight once in my life. They assured me my situation was NOT the norm, and hard work does, in most cases, reap a reward. They agreed to take my case and were very understanding as well as compassionate. They made the process much more comfortable, and when it was time to relive my experiences, they were there with me reassuring me that I had done the right thing by hiring them. They were honest and realistic with me. Although stressful, my situation is now resolved.  I would rely on them and or refer anyone in the same position. You should, at a minimum, sit and discuss your circumstances with their team. If you are reading this, then you are questioning whether or not to move forward with lawyers. My suggestion is to stop reading this and give them a call.",

After I dismissed my initial attorney and a second law firm agreed to help but then backed out, I thought I would have to handle my Work Comp case by myself - and that is NEVER a good idea.  Then, I found JML Law!  They took over and made sure I was taken care of.  I am very pleased with how they handled the case and interacted with me.  I am very pleased with the Settlement they negotiated!",

I left a voicemail and waited a week for his call back. His last name is Rodriguez. The attorney never returned the phone call. Unprofessional and careless to say the least. Very dissapointed.Edit: After posting this review, I received an e-mail from the attorney, Rodriguez to let me know that they read this review and that they tried to reach me many times. Unfortunately, that is UNTRUE as I check my e-mails and voice mails constantly. This also proves that they are NOT honest.",
