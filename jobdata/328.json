Their dedication and commitment to their clients and their families are truly admirable.Throughout my mother's case, Rager & Yoon went above and beyond, demonstrating exceptional professionalism and expertise. Their guidance and mentorship have not only helped my family but also inspired me to pursue a career in law myself.As a law student now, I can confidently say that Rager & Yoon has had a profound impact on my journey. Their unwavering dedication to justice and their clients is truly inspiring.I would also like to mention that Jeff is not only proficient in their legal practice, but they also value inclusivity. As a bilingual individual, I appreciate their commitment to assisting Spanish-speaking clients. Their willingness to bridge language barriers and provide equal access to justice is commendable.In conclusion, I am forever grateful for Jeff's support and guidance. Their exceptional legal expertise and genuine care for their clients make them an outstanding attorney.If you're looking for a dedicated and compassionate attorney, I highly recommend Jeff Rager.

            "description": "I\u2019m a physician who has always been devoted to being an advocate for the patients who are entrusted to my care. My patient advocacy conflicted with my previous employer\u2019s desire to place profits before patient care. This was unacceptable to me, and in searching for an attorney that would fight for justice, I found Mr. Rager. During one of the hardest chapters of my life, Mr. Rager was a zealous advocate for me. We fought until the bitter end and gave this behemoth of a corporation a run for their money, literally. While justice is not always perfect, I am proud we stood up for our principles and we made a formidable team. I highly recommend Mr. Rager as a zealous advocate for his clients and know that without him I would not have been able to fight for the proper treatment my patients deserved.",

            "description": "It was a hard time in my professional life when I reached out to The Rager Law Firm for help. I was in the fight of my life against an employer with nearly unlimited resources and a large team of lawyers. I was utterly intimidated as my former employer vigorously sought to achieve their goal of seeing me simply go away. So ruinous was their campaign against me, I was losing faith in myself and was beginning to question my own sanity. Nonetheless, I documented everything, and conducted myself in a professional, moral and legal manner at all times. Even when Security marched me out of the building with a box in my hands.Jeff Rager and his team listened to my story carefully. They reviewed my documentation. With great care, compassion, and understanding, he expertly guided my through the steps to seek justice and resolution. He advised and advocated for me throughout the process, expertly helped me manage risk, and in the end, I was highly satisfied with the result. Jeff restored my faith in myself, the law, and ultimately changed my life in a very positive way.If your employer broke the law, you can find justice. If you're not sure if your employer broke the law, call Jeff Rager and make an appointment. He will know if you have a case, and how to proceed. Don't wait- there is a time limit for you to initiate legal action. Call him today.I must recommend The Rager Law Firm for you. He helped me, and I cannot thank him enough for everything he did for me and my family!",

            "description": "Divine providence led me to the Rager Law Firm when I needed to retain strong legal representation on behalf of a family member.Just from my initial call with James Yoon, I knew there was no need to \u201cGoogle\u201d other law firms. James expertly guided us in the weeks that followed with the utmost professionalism, clarity, patience, and most importantly, kindness and empathy. James was consistently calm and collected as he responded to our questions and concerns and explained various aspects of the case\/process. Our voices were heard and validated compassionately.Likewise, Jeff Rager was assertive in the most compelling and effective way possible. He thoroughly understood and brilliantly argued the merits of the case, fiercely protected my family member\u2019s best interests, and \u201cwent for the jugular,\u201d resulting in a win with minimal effort on our part, except to show up with the facts and the truth about our situation. Jeff did not relent, and to say that we were pleased with and grateful for the outcome of his efforts is an understatement. That he was courteous and respectful to me and family made our experience that much more remarkable.Shout-out to Alana and Ashley who were exceptional in their follow-up and support as well.Wisdom, honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness might seem rare in the business world these days, but such virtues are alive and well among the Rager team. Truly well done!",

Jeff, James, Ashley & Alana were amazing and guided me through the whole lawsuit process. The team was very responsive and kept me informed as this was my 1st time needing legal counsel and I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Jeff & James believed in me & the case & never gave up on me. They worked around the clock to make sure the truth was put out in front of the judge and jury and they did an amazing job with telling my story and showing evidence that I was wronged.We faced a few challenges but that didn\u2019t hold the team back or make us fold. If anything, it made us fight harder for the truth. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better team to represent me on the matter & would definitely recommend the Rager Law Firm to have your back. I was treated with respect and the team carried themselves very professional in the courtroom and kept their cool. I can\u2019t say the same for the defense side. I feel a sense of Justice was served even though I wish I didn\u2019t have to go through what I went through. I am very grateful and appreciative that the Rager Law Firm brought closure to a difficult time in my life and I can move on.",

I had interviewed many attorneys and chose wisely. He and his associates are top notch. Thanks to Jeff, James and Alana, the outcome was well worth the time, hard work and effort.

I never thought anything would happen in my life where I would have to sue my employer, but I'm glad this team was there for me when I did. They explained how civil lawsuits are different than government action, and all the steps that came before, during, and after the lawsuit itself. We won and the outcome was fair. They made everything as easy on me as they possibly could. I know it took a lot of expertise and will for this team to fight on my behalf, against a large corporation with a problematic culture. That company is now being sued by several government agencies, but this firm helped me stand up to them as one of the first cases brought to light.

From the onset, Jeff immediately listened to me, collected the facts, analyzed my situation, realistically evaluated my case, and told me what to expect during each gateway of this legal process.  Prior to meeting Jeff, I was hesitant to commence a lawsuit against a goliath of a company as I was unsure that justice would be achieved.  This company had already mistreated me, cast me aside and made me feel that I had no voice after nearly 20 years of successful service and loyalty to them.  My whole world was turned upside down and I was emotionally wrecked.  Jeff made me feel empowered and was with me every step of the way.  I have never met more professional, reliable, responsive, and caring people!  It was just what I needed as I traversed this precarious path.  I felt that I had people on my side, giving me my voice back against this goliath.  I highly recommend Jeff Rager as I could not be happier with the outcome \u2013 it has changed my life in many ways, and I can finally heal!  Jeff and his team are one of the more knowledgeable firms out there, so do not waste your time looking any further \u2013 you can get your life back, I am living proof!",

We retained him to file a lawsuit against a $53 billion a year company that went on to hire an army of lawyers from two national law firms to represent them.Going up against this giant and powerful organization, and its horde of attorneys, was one of the most stressful experiences I have ever gone through. But throughout the entire 4-year battle, Jeff was there to encourage and support us.  For months, as the trial date approached, and during the trial itself, he worked on our hugely complex case 7 days a week, often staying up until the wee hours of the morning to prepare for trial.  His devotion, commitment, passion, and kindness carried us through some very challenging and scary moments during those 4 years, including the many times when we felt that we could no longer go on with our lawsuit against this Goliath.I really can\u2019t say enough positive things about Jeff.  If he believes in the merits of your case and accepts you as his client, you can be assured that nobody will work harder, more passionately, or more competently on your behalf than Jeff.  He is an exceptional attorney, a kind and caring human being, and, quite frankly, a giant-slayer.  I will never forget his courage and self-confidence in going up against the army of aggressive lawyers hired by the defendant.  (In the end, we won our case, and to the obvious surprise of the arrogant and powerful defendants and their legion of attorneys.)Jeff is a credit to a profession that is often not viewed very favorably.  He is honest, ethical, extremely knowledgeable, and once he accepts a case, he will work himself to the point of exhaustion to seek justice on behalf of his clients.",

After watching how he handled my case I was convinced he is one of the country's top employment law attorneys.I retained him in 2012 for what turned out to be a 3-year legal battle against a large government agency with what seemed to be endless funds and large staff of lawyers.  Other attorneys had feared taking on this entity and advised me that the chances of success were slim to none.  Mr. Rager sat with me for my initial 1 hour consultation and had a different view altogether and accepted my case.I found Mr. Rager to be a passionate, meticulous, extremely hardworking, and brilliant attorney.  Over the course of the 3 years that it took to finally get my settlement, he guided me through the overwhelming experience of filing a lawsuit, giving and taking depositions, and, finally, settling the case. He never once feared taking the case to trial if he did not feel the amount of settlement was not sufficient.At the end, despite the incredible arrogance of the defendants and their legal team, we were victorious.Despite his success in holding employers accountable for their unethical and malicious behavior against their employees, I found Mr. Rager different from other lawyers, he truly cared and understood the pain I was going through both professionally and personally. He continued to give me great advice throughout the entire experience and I am forever grateful...GOD BLESSIf Mr. Rager accepts your case, then you are one of the very lucky few, and should know that you have the best legal representation in the country.",
