I arrived on time for my appointment and I had to wait long to become my turn. I got call to schedule a new colonoscopy, I have a good PPO insurance, buy out of pocket was estimated for $1,700!! they did not offer any help to research potentially lowering the cost. I honestly don\u2019t have a positive experience with this place and Dr Robert. I don\u2019t know where these 4.5\/5 start come from.",

I was always treated with respect and my comfort and any concerns were never an issue, even the 3 times I called him the week before my last surgery being that I had such a  challenging year with my health. He was patient, kind, understanding, and most importantly, skillful. I am thankful everyday for my experience with Dr. Yavrouian.",

He gave me a plan on how to take care of myself after I went into surgery and I followed with that plan and my results ended up being so good. I had minor pain the first couple of days which he warned me about but I ended up going through the first couple of days with a little bit of pain and it went away. The experience with this doctor for me was very awesome and a experience that left a good memory for me and I will definitely be coming back to him if I ever need be. The doctor has a very great attitude and a very warm welcoming personality thank you Dr Yavourian",

I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working alongside Dr. Yavrouian for years and have not met another doctor  who\u2019s more compassionate and caring. Therefore, when it came to myself needing surgery it was a very easy decision to choose him. I had the utmost conference that he would take great care of me and he did not disappoint. From seeing me in the office and  going over my options all the way to the operating room my experience was nothing but pleasant. He\u2019s calm and collected, very professional, never rushes through anything and takes all the time to answer any questions and\/or concerns. My recovery was nearly painless and the scarring was minimal. I\u2019m grateful for having him as my doctor and for making this an amazing experience for me.",

First the front reception staff wasn't wearing masks when I was there and are very grumpy for some reason and speaking some other languge behind your back.This dr has zero compassion and doesn't seem to really care about his patients as he has so many waiting to see him . He basically rushes you out the door. He seems mentally checked out because he is so booked with patients that he just asks a few questions and then offers a painful surgery without any other options.I got hurt during a procedure here last year but never left a comment til today.
