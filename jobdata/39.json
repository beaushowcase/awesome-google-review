Something to keep in mind, he is GOOD and manages a lot of clients so if he has a stand in because he's working on another high profile case don't get discourages and just leave a message with his front desk. He's helped me with with 3 different cases with completely different parameters because he is so knowledgeable in his field.",

I was in a very bad place and we needed out and the only way to do so led to a random Google search to calling David\u2019s office. His office staff is superb! I can\u2019t say that enough. The first communication with David made my daughter and I feel we picked the right number. He scheduled our zoom meeting for the next day. From that meeting he made us feel at ease and we would be safe. Then we went to his office. He made us feel that we would be okay, not to worry as we were shaken and very upset, that he had us and he would make sure we would be okay and he\u2019d be ready for a fight. My situation was  difficult and even though the stress was still enormous we knew we had the right attorney. He answered every call or made sure he got back to me. He explained everything and was always there for another phone call and more questions. His office staff is amazing. They took their time with every call I made or every email. No matter what I needed they were there!! My life was turned upside down but I had the best attorney I could have hoped for. Even after all was said and done I still had more questions and they are all 100% in as if I called the first time. You won\u2019t find a better attorney\/office to help you. They treat you as if you were their only client. I can\u2019t thank them enough!!",

I have contacted other attorneys and they would either call back a couple of days later or not at all. Each and every time I contacted him either he answered or got back to me the same day no matter what day of the week it was. I would not recommend any other attorney except for David.",

My experience with David Smith and his office was a completely friendly and stress free atmosphere. Everyone here was great and David Smith really took the extra time and effort in order to help me. As it turned out, my situation ended up not needing legal experience but David Smith still took the time out of his day to give me great advice and followed up on my situation. I definitely recommend them and really appreciate their help!",

I first called David at 6 PM one evening - he asked us to come right over and continued to work with us for several hours into the AM hours.  I was blown away and knew we had found someone extraordinary.He continues to work closely with our very complicated case, never judging and always caring. This is probably the most stressful of life has been to date, and I am so incredibly grateful that David is there for us. Our situation could have ended very badly and it is only because of David that we are getting through this and I am confident that he has set us up for success going forward.",

At age 65, bankruptcy was not even a thought in my retirement bucket list a myriad of problems to be negotiated. Mr. Smith and his staff and associates were very kind and helpful as I was quite uncomfortable in this experience. They assured me that I wasn't alone and everything would be okay. Now, 5years later life is good again I still have my home thanks to friends, family and a good and kind attorney.",

He is such a kind person, and how quickly he helped us and gave us advice made us feel so secure and grateful. He was ready for anything to come, ready for a fight if it was needed. Him or his office ALWAYS got back to us when we need to call and see what was going on. If you need a good support to help you get through a hard time, this is the place to go.
